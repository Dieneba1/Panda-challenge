  1.Male tend to play way more than female, dominating the category with 84%. They also purchase 5times more than the females.
  
  2. Although we have fewer female players, their average purchasing price is higher than that of males.this shows that Females are likely to spend more dollars on a game than males will do.
  
  3.We notice that the highest number of players fall within age 20-24 followed by players aged between 15-19. Also, by sorting our final Dataframes by Total purchase value vs purchase count, we noticed that some of the items such as "Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm" and "Extraction, Quickblade Of Trembling Hands" which can be seen in the top 5 most  popular items are not part of the top 5 most profitable items.
